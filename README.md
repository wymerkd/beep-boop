# _Beep Boop_

#### _A web application that takes a number from a user and displays a range of numbers or a message depending on the user's input, 11/01/2019_

#### By _**Kyle Wymer**_

## Description

_This project demonstrates my current skills and understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Javascript, and jQuery. The application consists of a form that collects a number inputted by the user and runs the data through a series of loops and branching to determine which output is displayed back to the user. The resulting output will appear on the page when the submit button is clicked._


## Specifications

|  Behavior | Input  | Output  |
|---|---|---|
| The application returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number| 4 | 1, 2, 3, 4  |
| Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced with "Beep!" unless it also contains a 2 or a 3| 11 | "Beep!" |
| Numbers that contain a 2 are replaced with "Boop!" unless it also contains a 3 | 12 | "Boop!" |
| Numbers that contain a 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." | 13  |  "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." |
